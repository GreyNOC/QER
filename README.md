# GreyNOC Quantum Exposure Radar (QER)

> Don't build a new cipher. Build the thing defenders actually lack: **visibility.**

QER is a **defensive** scanner and monitor that builds a live cryptographic bill
of materials (CBOM), classifies every primitive against the quantum threat,
scores post‑quantum (PQC) migration readiness, flags **harvest‑now‑decrypt‑later
(HNDL)** exposure, watches for **hybrid/PQ downgrades**, and emits ready‑to‑load
**SIEM** detection content and an **executive migration map**.

This repository is the **v0.1 MVP**: the *Network/TLS radar* vertical slice. It
performs real TLS handshakes, parses real certificates, and produces real
findings. See [Scope & honesty](#scope--honesty) for exactly what is and isn't
implemented yet, and [Roadmap](#roadmap) for the rest of the vision.

## Why

A cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) breaks the hard problems
behind RSA, finite‑field Diffie‑Hellman, and elliptic‑curve crypto (ECDH/ECDSA/
EdDSA) via Shor's algorithm. The dangerous part isn't the future — it's **today**:
an adversary can record TLS traffic now and decrypt it later once a CRQC exists.
By **Mosca's inequality**, you have a problem whenever

```
(data secrecy lifetime) + (migration time) > (time until a CRQC exists)
```

Defenders can't migrate what they can't see. QER is the inventory + risk + alert
layer that tells you *which systems to fix first and why.*

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows  (source .venv/bin/activate on *nix)
pip install -e .                    # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.10 and the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/)
package (for certificate parsing). Everything else is the standard library.

## Quick start

```bash
# Scan a couple of hosts
qer scan github.com cloudflare.com:443

# Scan a target list with business context, diff against a baseline,
# and emit every SIEM format into ./out
qer scan -f data/targets.example.txt \
         --baseline .qer_baseline.json --update-baseline \
         --out-dir out --format json,ndjson,sigma,splunk,kql,zeek

# CI gate: non‑zero exit if anything reaches HIGH
qer scan -f data/targets.json --fail-on high

# Offline code & dependency scan (shift‑left)
qer code path/to/repo --json out/code.json --fail-on high

# Measure PQ coverage of real traffic from a Zeek ssl.log
qer passive /var/log/zeek/ssl.log --min-connections 5

# Scan once, re-emit to any format later (no re-scan)
qer scan example.com --json report.json
qer export -i report.json -f cyclonedx,sigma,splunk,kql --out-dir siem/

# Self-contained HTML "radar" dashboard (open offline in any browser)
qer scan -f data/targets.example.txt --format html --out-dir out   # -> out/qer-radar.html
```

Example console output:

## How it classifies crypto

All classification lives in [`qer/classify.py`](qer/classify.py) — pure logic,
no I/O. Each primitive gets one of four quantum‑risk levels:

| Level | Meaning | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| `broken-now` | Weak today, independent of quantum | TLS ≤ 1.1, RC4, 3DES, MD5/SHA‑1 sigs, RSA < 2048 |
| `quantum-vulnerable` | Broken by Shor's algorithm | RSA, DH/DHE, ECDH/ECDHE, ECDSA, EdDSA |
| `quantum-weakened` | Halved by Grover but usable | AES‑128 (~64‑bit post‑Grover) |
| `pq-safe` | Post‑quantum / hybrid, or strong symmetric | ML‑KEM/Kyber, ML‑DSA, AES‑256, ChaCha20, X25519MLKEM768 |

The key insight the tool encodes: **`ECDHE‑RSA‑AES256‑GCM‑SHA384` is
`quantum-vulnerable`, not safe.** AES‑256 is fine, but the *ECDHE key exchange*
is the HNDL problem — a recorded handshake is decryptable once a CRQC exists.
Forward secrecy protects you against a *classical* future key theft, not a
quantum one.

## Scoring (`qer/scoring.py`)

* **HNDL risk (0–100)** — the marquee metric. Driven specifically by
  quantum‑vulnerable **key exchange** (not signatures — you can't retroactively
  forge a signature over already‑accepted traffic), weighted by data shelf life,
  sensitivity, and exposure. RSA key transport (no forward secrecy) is the worst
  case; PQ/hybrid key exchange scores 0.
* **risk_score (0–100)** — overall migration urgency: HNDL combined with
  present‑day hygiene (legacy TLS, lost forward secrecy, weak ciphers, expiry).
* **migration_difficulty (0–100)** — mostly the inverse of crypto agility.
* **readiness (0–100)** — how modern/agile the endpoint already is (a quick‑win
  signal, *not* a claim it's post‑quantum).
* **priority** — `NOW` / `SOON` / `LATER` / `OK`, the basis of the migration map.

Business context (sensitivity, shelf life, exposure, agility) is supplied by you
per target — the scanner measures the crypto, you supply the stakes, QER combines
them. See [the targets file](#targets-file).

## Downgrade monitor (`qer/downgrade.py`)

Snapshot an endpoint's posture, then on every re‑scan alert when it **regresses**:
TLS version drops, forward secrecy is lost, the cipher or key shrinks, newly‑
accepted legacy versions appear, or a previously‑negotiated **PQ/hybrid key
exchange disappears** (the headline hybrid‑downgrade alert — `QER-DG-PQ`,
emitted at *critical*). Enforcement can also *relax* without fully disappearing
(`QER-DG-PQ-ENFORCE`). Use `--baseline FILE [--update-baseline]`.

## Post‑quantum: support, enforcement, and measured coverage

QER answers PQ at three increasing levels of confidence:

1. **Support** — does the server offer a hybrid group at all? [`qer/pqprobe.py`](qer/pqprobe.py)
   sends a raw TLS 1.3 ClientHello advertising *only* the hybrid group with an
   empty key share; a HelloRetryRequest selecting it proves support on any
   OpenSSL.
2. **Enforcement** — does it *insist* on PQ, or merely tolerate it? The
   **preference probe** offers `[hybrid, x25519]` *with* an x25519 key share. If
   the server still HelloRetryRequests for the hybrid group it **enforces** PQ;
   if it completes classically it only **tolerates** it (the common case — even
   Cloudflare/Google accept classical when the client offers it). Enforcement
   drives HNDL lower (kex factor 0.05 vs 0.15 for mere support).
3. **Measured coverage** — what fraction of *real* traffic actually got PQ?
   `qer passive` reads a Zeek `ssl.log` (TSV or JSON) and reports the share of
   observed connections whose negotiated `curve` is hybrid, per service —
   turning "supported" into a measured **% protected** and surfacing the
   classical‑client tail that is still HNDL‑exposed. [`qer/passive.py`](qer/passive.py)

```bash
qer scan cloudflare.com            # support + enforcement, live
qer passive /var/log/zeek/ssl.log  # measured % PQ coverage of real traffic
```

The emitted Zeek script ([`qer export ... zeek`](qer/siem/zeek.py)) adds a
`qer_pq` column to `ssl.log`, so the sensor that flags weak TLS in real time also
produces the data `qer passive` consumes.

## Code & dependency scan (`qer code`)

The offline companion to the network radar. It walks a repo and inventories
cryptography *in source*, feeding the same `Finding` model, quantum
classification, and NDJSON SIEM feed:

* asymmetric usage (RSA / DSA / DH / ECDSA / Ed25519 / X25519) — quantum‑vulnerable
* broken‑now primitives (MD5, SHA‑1, DES/3DES, RC4)
* JWT/JWS signing algorithms — `RS*/ES*/PS*/EdDSA`, and the dangerous `alg:none` (critical)
* SAML / XML‑DSig signature & digest methods — SHA‑1/MD5 (broken), RSA/ECDSA XML signatures (quantum‑vulnerable), plus SAML libraries
* post‑quantum libraries (ML‑KEM/Kyber, ML‑DSA/Dilithium, SLH‑DSA, liboqs) — a *good* signal
* hardcoded PEM private keys (a secret‑in‑repo finding) and certificates
* SSH keys (by type) and crypto libraries in dependency manifests

```bash
qer code . --min-severity medium
```

Every finding carries a `file:line` location. The scan is **heuristic**
(pattern matching over text, like grep‑based SAST): it will match crypto terms
in comments and string literals, so treat it as an inventory/triage aid, not a
proof of exploitable usage. [codescan.py](qer/codescan.py)

## SIEM output (`qer/siem/`)

| Format | What it is |
|--------|-----------|
| `json` | Full nested report (CBOM + findings + scores) |
| `ndjson` | One denormalised event per finding — the canonical SIEM feed |
| `cyclonedx` | **CycloneDX 1.6 CBOM** — a standards-compliant cryptographic bill of materials (crypto-asset components for protocols, certificates, and algorithms) |
| `html` | **Self-contained "radar" dashboard** — a single offline HTML file (no external deps) with the migration map, per-endpoint CBOM, PQ status, and findings |
| `sigma` | Portable Sigma rules over the QER feed **and** over Zeek `ssl` telemetry |
| `splunk` | SPL searches + `savedsearches.conf` alert stanzas (`sourcetype=qer:finding`) |
| `kql` | Microsoft Sentinel / Log Analytics queries over a `QER_CL` custom table |
| `zeek` | A Zeek policy script that flags weak/quantum‑vulnerable TLS **on the wire** |

The `ndjson` event schema (see [`qer/siem/json_out.py`](qer/siem/json_out.py)) is
the contract the Sigma/Splunk/KQL content is written against.

## Targets file

`.json` (full profiles) or annotated text — see
[`data/targets.example.txt`](data/targets.example.txt):

```
host[:port]  label="Name" sensitivity=1..5 shelf_life=<years>
             exposure=internal|partner|external agility=1..5 expect_pq=true|false
```

Unannotated lines use sensible defaults (`sensitivity=3, shelf_life=5,
exposure=external, agility=3`).

## Scope & honesty

QER is deliberately honest about its limits rather than overclaiming:

* **Active PQ probing works** via [`qer/pqprobe.py`](qer/pqprobe.py) — a
  dependency‑free raw TLS 1.3 ClientHello that proves hybrid‑group support on any
  OpenSSL (verified live against Cloudflare/Google). The **preference probe**
  further distinguishes *enforcement* from mere *tolerance*, and `qer passive`
  measures the actual PQ share of real traffic — so the old "support ≠
  negotiation" gap is now addressed at three levels (support → enforcement →
  measured coverage). The one residual: a support/enforcement probe still
  reflects server behaviour, not a census of every client.
* **Full certificate-chain CBOM works** via [`qer/cert_chain.py`](qer/cert_chain.py) —
  a raw TLS 1.2 handshake captures the plaintext `Certificate` message and parses
  every link (leaf + intermediate CAs), since stdlib `ssl` exposes only the leaf on
  3.11. TLS 1.3-only servers encrypt that message, so QER falls back to the stdlib
  leaf there (use `--no-chain` to skip chain capture entirely).
* **The code scanner is heuristic** (regex over text). Like grep‑based SAST it
  matches crypto terms in comments and string literals; it is an inventory aid,
  not proof of exploitable usage.
* QER is an **inventory and risk‑visibility** tool. It does not exploit,
  intercept, or modify traffic. Scan only systems you are authorized to assess.
